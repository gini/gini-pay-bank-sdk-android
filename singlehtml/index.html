<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Gini Pay provides an information extraction system for analyzing business invoices and
transfers them to the Android banking app, where the payment process will be completed.
The Gini Pay Bank SDK for Android provides functionality to capture documents with mobile
phones, accurate line item extraction enables the user to uncheck the items they don&#8217;t
want to pay and automatically calculates the new amountToPay.</p>

<h4>Integration<a class="headerlink" href="#integration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The entry point into the library is GiniPayBank object which lets you interact with the Capture and Payment features.
The Capture feature is a layer of abstraction above <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gini/gini-capture-sdk-android/">Gini Capture SDK</a> and the Return Assistant feature.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Capture feature can be used with:</dt>

<li>the Screen API by calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">startCaptureFlow</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">startCaptureFlowForIntent</span></tt>.</li>
<li>the Component API by building everything around the provided fragments.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>See example apps for more details about usage of Screen and Component APIs.</p>
<p>To use capture features, they need to be configured with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setCaptureConfiguration</span></tt>.
Note that configuration is immutable. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">releaseCapture</span></tt> needs to be called before passing a new configuration.</p>
<p>To use the pay feature you need to add to your manifest an intent filter for the ginipay URI:</p>

<h4>Capture Feature<a class="headerlink" href="#capture-feature" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Communication with the Gini API is not part of the Gini Capture SDK in order to allow clients
the freedom to use a networking implementation of their own choosing. The quickest way to add
networking is to use the Gini Capture Network Library, which you can use by providing
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GiniCaptureNetworkService</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GiniCaptureDefaultNetworkApi</span></tt> to the configuration.
There are helper methods which provide minimal configuration for Service and API:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>`` getDefaultNetworkService(context: Context, clientId: String, clientSecret: String, emailDomain: String, documentMetadata: DocumentMetadata)``</li>
<li>`` getDefaultNetworkApi(service: GiniCaptureDefaultNetworkService)``</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You may also use the Gini Pay API lib for Android or implement communication with the Gini API yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pay-feature">
<h4>Pay Feature<a class="headerlink" href="#pay-feature" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The pay feature depends on the Gini Pay API lib, which provides an entry point through <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Gini</span></tt> class.
The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Gini</span></tt> class can be built either with client credentials (clientId and clientSecret)
or with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SessionManager</span></tt> if you have a token. For these two cases there are helper methods:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getGiniApi(context:</span> <span class="pre">Context,</span> <span class="pre">clientId:</span> <span class="pre">String,</span> <span class="pre">clientSecret:</span> <span class="pre">String,</span> <span class="pre">emailDomain:</span> <span class="pre">String)</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getGiniApi(context:</span> <span class="pre">Context,</span> <span class="pre">sessionManager:</span> <span class="pre">SessionManager)</span></tt></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SessionManager</span></tt> is an interface which you need to implement to send the token.</p>
<p>For more details about <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Gini</span></tt> see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gini/gini-pay-api-lib-android/">Gini Pay API lib</a>.</p>

<span id="document-capture"></span><div class="section" id="capture">
<h3>Capture<a class="headerlink" href="#capture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The capture feature provides Activities and Fragments for capturing,
reviewing and analyzing photos of invoices and remittance slips.</p>
<p>By integrating this feature into your application you can allow your
users to easily take pictures of documents, review them
and - by implementing the necessary networking interfaces - upload
the document to the Gini API for analysis.</p>
<p>See authentication section for more details on configuring communication with the backend.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Capture feature can be used with:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>the Screen API by calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">startCaptureFlow</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">startCaptureFlowForIntent</span></tt>.</li>
<li>the Component API by building everything around the provided fragments.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>See example apps for more details about usage of Screen and Component APIs.</p>
<p>To use capture features, they need to be configured with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setCaptureConfiguration</span></tt>.
Note that configuration is immutable. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">releaseCapture</span></tt> needs to be called before passing a new configuration.</p>
<p>The capture feature consists of the following screens:
Onboarding: Provides useful hints to the user on how to take a perfect photo of a document.
Camera: The actual camera screen to capture the image of the document.
Review: Offers the opportunity to the user to check the sharpness of the image and to rotate it into reading direction, if necessary.
Analysis: Provides a UI for the analysis process of the document by showing the user a loading indicator and the image of the document.
Digital Invoice: Provides UI in which the user case unselect and edit extracted line items.</p>
<p>The configuration class allows you to change the default behaviour of the screens. See Configuration class for more details on each field.</p>
</div>
<span id="document-pay"></span><div class="section" id="pay">
<h3>Pay<a class="headerlink" href="#pay" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Pay feature provides the API for receiving a payment request started
by a Business app, mark it as payed and return to the app that started
the flow.</p>
<p>The pay feature needs to be initialized by calling GiniPayBank.setGiniApi().
See authentication sections for more details.</p>
<p>To use the pay feature you need to add to your manifest an intent filter for
the ginipay URI so that it is discoverable by the business apps:</p>
<div class="highlight-kotlin"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">intent</span><span class="p">-</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="n">intent</span><span class="p">-</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The intent filter can be added to the activity which will handle the payment flow of
that payment request.</p>
<p>The flow is:
1. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getRequestId</span></tt> to extract the id from the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Intent</span></tt>
2. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getPaymentRequest</span></tt> to get payment details set by the business app.
3. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">resolvePaymentRequest</span></tt> to mark the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PaymentRequest</span></tt> as paid.
4. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">returnToBusiness</span></tt> to return to the business app that started the flow.</p>

<h3>Customization<a class="headerlink" href="#customization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

This means that all <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gini/gini-pay-bank-sdk-android/tree/main/ginipaybank/src/main/res">resources of the library</a>
can be overridden by providing resources with the same name in the

<p>Some attributes are set inside the library (styles that start with

styles to customize the screen further.</p>

       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Examples

## Invoice Capture

We are providing example apps for the Screen API and the Component API. These apps demonstrate how
to integrate the Gini Pay Bank SDK's invoice capture feature:

You can find the example apps in the following modules:

- `appcomponentapi` for the Component API
- `appscreenapi` for the Screen API

## Payment Requests

You can find an example on how to handle payment requests in the `appscreenapi` module's `PayActivity`. 

For testing the payment flow integration you can use the example app from [Business
SDK](https://github.com/gini/gini-pay-business-sdk-android#example-apps) to create payment requests.

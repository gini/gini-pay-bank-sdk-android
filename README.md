Gini Pay Bank SDK for Android
===============================

**Deprecation Notice**
----------------------

The Gini Pay Bank SDK for Android was replaced by the new
[Gini Bank SDK](https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/blob/main/bank-sdk/).

This SDK won't be developed further and we kindly ask you to switch to the new Gini Bank SDK. Migration entails only a
few steps which you can find in this 
[migration guide](https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/blob/main/bank-sdk/migrate-from-other-bank-sdk.md).

* [Reference Docs](http://developer.gini.net/gini-pay-bank-sdk-android/kdoc/index.html)

Examples
--------

## Invoice Capture

We are providing example apps for the Screen API and the Component API. These apps demonstrate how
to integrate the Gini Pay Bank SDK's invoice capture feature:

You can find the example apps in the following modules:

- `appcomponentapi` for the Component API
- `appscreenapi` for the Screen API

## Payment Requests

You can find an example on how to handle payment requests in the `appscreenapi` module's `PayActivity`. 

For testing the payment flow integration you can use the example app from [Business
SDK](https://github.com/gini/gini-pay-business-sdk-android#example-apps) to create payment requests.
